import { Callout, Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs';

## Prerequisites
> * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
> * [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
> * [Latest/any Grasscutter JAR](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/releases)
> * [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) or [Fiddler Classic](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler)

## Starting the server
1. Create an empty folder with any name
2. Put the downloaded Grasscutter .jar file into the folder
3. `Shift + Right Click` then click `Open PowerShell window here`
4. Put in: `java -jar <grasscutter jar filename>`
<Callout type="info">
  This will create additional folders in your working directory.
</Callout>
5. Download:
> * [Grasscutter Resources](https://git.crepe.moe/grasscutters/Grasscutter_Resources/-/raw/main/Grasscutter_Resources-3.3.zip?inline=false)
> * [Keystore](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/raw/development/keystore.p12)
6. After, put those files into the folder (directory) you made earlier.
<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE**\
  If you are running in the project's root folder (ie. you cloned the repo from GitHub and you are running the server in that folder), these files will be already be present.
  Also, you can either extract the Grasscutter resources .zip file OR, optionally you can **keep it as zip, then change config.json when the server is ready and change resources path to where the zip is (recommended to put the .zip in the folder that you made, so you can just use `"resources": "./res.zip"`). This is so that the resources don't take much storage.**
</Callout>

7. Put in `java -jar <grasscutter jar filename>` in the terminal again.

## Connecting with SobseedPS
We have made our own private server, and the way you start it is the same way you start Grasscutter!\
So, if you would like to play on our server, follow all the steps above, except instead of downloading Grasscutter's .jar, [download SobseedPS' jar file!](https://sobroom.rrryfoo.cf/sobseed/spcfrm-psdoc)
