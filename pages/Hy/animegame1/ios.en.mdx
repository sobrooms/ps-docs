## Installing
After you have downloaded Scarlet and the ipa, go into Scarlet, tap on the middle/2nd button in the bottom bar, and tap on the button in the top-right corner.

When the popup appears, locate the ipa you just downloaded and tap on it. This will install the app.

When it is ready, it will give you a popup prompting you to install the game. Install it.

## Entering the server
After you have installed the game, enter it, login to an account with any credentials by clicking on the "mi" button.\
Then, download game resources... and go in.

    If download speeds are slow, switch servers until you find a server with fast download speed. (i have no patience and gave up because i did this yet it was still slow anyway)
