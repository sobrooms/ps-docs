# Connecting to Android GI PS
<Callout type="info">
  **This method uses a renamed folder package name, so you need the official game data from the [official app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact&hl=en_US&gl=US).**
</Callout>

## Prerequisites
1. Download one of the [modded app launchers](https://docs.ps.rrryfoo.cf/GenshinImpact/wyuukips_android#modded-launchers-apk)
2. Download and install the official game. **Make sure you download the game's data first by playing for the first time on the official server (or just atleast just go in the game and tap when the game loads, to download game files)**. You may also download audio packs if you would like. (in-game's *Audio* tab in settings).
3. Download and install the "Ziparchive" application.
4. Open *Ziparchive* and find the game's data folder in **`storage/emulated/0/Android/data`** and find a folder named **`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`**.
5. Rename `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact` to `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact.backup`. (*Android 13 will need root access to do this, Android 11-12 or other versions don't need root access*)
6. Then after this, uninstall the official application (not the game folder, but the actual application named "Genshin Impact" in your home screen). Aftee that, install one of the [modded app launchers](https://ps-docs.theonesaya.repl.co/GenshinImpact/wyuukips_android#modded-launchers-apk).
7. Open *Ziparchive* again and find the backup of the game data's folder, which is still located in **`/storage/emulated/0/Android/data`** (the one that you should have named `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact.backup`)
8. Rename the backup folder back to the original name. (the original name is `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`)
9. Open *Genshin Impact* and play the private server

So if the md5 of the downloaded zip part files is different, then redownload them.

## Frequently asked questions
<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¬">
  **Q: 'Why am I stuck at "Preparing to load data - 0.00%'?"**\
  *A: If you actually read everything, you must first download the game's data from the official game. You cannot skip this. Alternatively, if you don't want to download from the official game, you can download game data from somewhere else, or from a backup of your other phone...*

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¬">
  **Q: "What's the difference between V1 and V2?"**\
  *A: V1 can only connect to the YuukiPS server.\
  V2 can also connect to localhost, official server (sometimes), and YuukiPS. Also 0kb download speed is fixed in this update. (V2 can play the official server only for rooted devices (if they have skill to know how to do that)*

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¬">
  **Q: "What's the difference between GIO and the Grasscutter Server?"**\
  *A: GIO is a clone of the official server, which means all functions work without any bugs and quests. All works but can only be ran on 3.2.\
  The Grasscutter server is a server emulator that can run on the latest versions and beta versions, but a lot of functions don't work, it's just that commands are easier because they can be accessed via the Ayaka's bot chat.*

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¬">
  **Q: "How do I fix '[Failed to load il2cpp](https://github.com/YuukiPS/Launcher-Android/issues/3)'?"**\
  *A: Fix this by deleting the folder named `Unity` and `il2cpp` in Genshin's game data folder.*
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¬">
  **Q: "How do I fix 'Error 4214'?"**\
