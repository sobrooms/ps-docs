# Connecting to Android GI PS
<Callout type="info">
  **This method uses a renamed folder package name, so you need the official game data from the [official app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact&hl=en_US&gl=US).**
</Callout>

## Prerequisites
1. Download one of the [modded app launchers](https://docs.ps.rrryfoo.cf/GenshinImpact/wyuukips_android#modded-launchers-apk)
2. Download and install the official game. **Make sure you download the game's data first by playing for the first time on the official server (or just atleast just go in the game and tap when the game loads, to download game files)**. You may also download audio packs if you would like. (in-game's *Audio* tab in settings).
3. Download and install the "Ziparchive" application.
4. Open *Ziparchive* and find the game's data folder in **`storage/emulated/0/Android/data`** and find a folder named **`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`**.
5. Rename `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact` to `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact.backup`. (*Android 13 will need root access to do this, Android 11-12 or other versions don't need root access*)
6. Then after this, uninstall the official application (not the game folder, but the actual application named "Genshin Impact" in your home screen). Aftee that, install one of the [modded app launchers](https://ps-docs.theonesaya.repl.co/GenshinImpact/wyuukips_android#modded-launchers-apk).
7. Open *Ziparchive* again and find the backup of the game data's folder, which is still located in **`/storage/emulated/0/Android/data`** (the one that you should have named `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact.backup`)
8. Rename the backup folder back to the original name. (the original name is `com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`)
9. Open *Genshin Impact* and play the private server
